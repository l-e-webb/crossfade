# CrossFade

A simple puzzle game made by Ashlen ([Tangled Web Games](https://tangledwebgames.itch.io)).

CrossFade takes place on a square grid of tiles.  (A 5 by 5 grid in the current version.)  Each tile is either lit up or off.  You can "move" on a tile by clicking it, and this reverses the on/off value of every tile in that tile's row and column, including the selected tile itself.  The goal is to reduce the board back to a blank state where all tiles are off.

Note that this game is currently under development.  New features are still being added.
