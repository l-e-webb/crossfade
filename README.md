#CrossFade

A simple puzzle game made by Louis Webb

##Version

This is game is currently in alpha v0.2.  Updates to come include:

* A more logical sequence of levels.

* More stylish UI.

* Music and sound effects.

* Animation for tile flipping.

* Settings menu for adjusting music, sound effects, and animation.

##Gameplay

CrossFade takes place on a square grid of tiles.  (A 5 by 5 grid in the current version.)  Each tile is either lit up or off.  You can "move" on a tile by clicking it, and this reverses the on/off value of every tile in that tile's row and column, including the selected tile itself.  The goal is to reduce the board back to a blank state where all tiles are off.
